And on his farm he had a pig, e i e i o.
With an oink oink here and an oink oink there,
Here an oink, there an oink, everywhere an oink oink.
Old MacDonald had a farm, e i e i o.

And on his farm he had a duck, e i e i o.
With a quack quack here and a quack quack there,
Here a quack, there a quack, everywhere a quack quack.
